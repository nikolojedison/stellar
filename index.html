<div id="lol">1. who wrote this? <a href="nikolaimallett.me">i did,</a> <a href="mailto:nikolaimallett@gmail.com">send me questions!</a></div>
<div id="lol">2. how do i use it? click some links, it's relatively self-explanatory</div>
<div id="lol">3. why was it written? this database is meant to help members of the Phoenix<br /> 
Command Group (PCG) keep track of locations, whether they're fictional stars and<br />
planets or real stars. expansion of the site's capabilities will continue<br />
throughout summer and fall 2017.</div>
<div id="lol">4. why is it ugly? it isn't. it's meant to emulate an old-school computer<br />
terminal, of the sort that was used in mainframes or to play the original Elite<br />
games.</div>
